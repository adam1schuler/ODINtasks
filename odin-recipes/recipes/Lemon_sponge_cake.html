    <p>This light, lemony cake makes for a delicate and delicious dessert, especially when topped with whipped cream and fresh berries. 
        Here's a fluffy and flavorful cake that's simple to make with our easy-to-follow recipe. The glazed lemon chiffon cake may sound fancy, but it's a delicious dessert that'll taste great for any gathering.

    <p>Lemon sponge cake is a light, springy cake made from flour, whisked eggs, sugar, and fresh lemon. The defining feature of a sponge cake is the whisked eggs—the foamy structure of the eggs allows the cake to rise without baking powder or baking soda. The airy texture of sponge cake absorbs liquid, which is why it serves as the base for desserts like tres leches cake and trifle.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>All-Purpose Flour</strong> I tested this recipe with Gold Medal Unbleached 
        All Purpose Flour. It gives me reliable results every time. One of my primary goals in 
        creating this recipe was finding a great sponge cake that used only all-purpose flour, which 
        most of us always have in our pantry. 
        <li><strong>Baking Powder</strong> These provide the dough with just a bit of lift, giving 
            the cookies that soft and tender texture. Be sure to replace your baking soda every 
            few months (yes! every few months!). Old baking powder won’t give you the same results as 
            a fresh box. </li>
        <li><strong>Buttermilk </strong> Helps create a tender crumb.</li>
        <li><strong>Unsalted Butter</strong>- It is important to use unsalted butter to get the 
                    measurement for salt (see below) right. If using salted butter, it’s a good idea 
                    to skip the added kosher salt in the dough so that the cookies don’t become too 
                    salty. Don’t forget to take the butter out of the fridge in advance. It needs to be 
                    softened while still feeling slightly cool to the touch. </li>
        <li><strong>Lemon Zest + Lemon Extract </strong> How you make lemon flavor cake! Lemon extract has a concentrated flavor, which helps the lemon shine.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs and Pure Vanilla Extract</strong>You can’t have great sponge cake without these two things. The eggs add texture, the vanilla extract 
                            adds flavor. Egg yolks are essential to giving your cake that familiar spongy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Fresh Lemons </strong>These are the classic, but see below for <a href="#other-ideas">other ideas!</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredient Amounts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>175g </strong>unsalted butter, softened, plus extra for the tin</li>
        <li><strong>175g </strong>granulated white sugar</li>
        <li><strong>3 </strong>large eggs </li>
        <li><strong>3 </strong>large unwaxed lemons, zested, plus 4-4 ½ tbsp juice </li>
        <li><strong>250g </strong>self-raising flour </li>
        <li><strong>½ tsp </strong>baking powder </li>
        <li><strong>100g </strong>Greek yogurt </li>
        <li><strong>400g </strong>icing sugar </li>
        <!--<li><strong></strong></li> commented out, the extra <l1> from the template-->
        <li><strong>½ cup </strong><a href="#other-ideas"><mark>other ideas!</mark></a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 170C/150C fan/gas 3. Butter a deep, loose-bottomed, 18cm cake tin and line the base with baking parchment.</li>
        <li>Beat the butter and caster sugar together with an electric whisk until fluffy and pale in color. Crack the eggs in one at a time, beating well after each addition, then stir in the lemon zest. Fold in the flour, baking powder and ½ tsp salt, then fold in the yogurt.</li>
        <li>Add <a href="#other-ideas"><mark>other ideas!</mark></a> to the mixture</li>
        <li>Spoon the mixture into the lined tin, smoothing the top with a spatula. Bake in the centre of the oven for 50-55 mins, or until golden brown on top and firm to the touch. Cool in the tin for 10 mins before turning out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Will keep in an airtight container for up to four days, or in the freezer for up to a month.</li>
        <li>When you’re ready to decorate, sieve the icing sugar into a bowl and beat in enough of the lemon juice to create a thick icing. Set the cake on a serving plate or cake stand, then spoon over the icing, allowing it to drip down the sides a little. Top with the lemon zest or candied peel, if using (see below), and cut into generous wedges to serve.</li>
        <li>To make candied lemon peel, peel large, wide strips from the lemons using a vegetable peeler. Remove any pith with a knife, then julienne the peel into very thin matchsticks. Tip the granulated sugar into a saucepan with 200ml water and set over a medium heat until the sugar has dissolved. Add the lemon peel and simmer gently for 15 mins, then scoop the peel out using a slotted spoon and set on a piece of kitchen paper to cool. Use to decorate the top of your cake.</li>

    <blockquote>"I loved this cake, it turned out beautifully light and moist. It took a little longer to bake than the recipe states. On the advice of others I halved the quantity of icing and that was perfect, the whole amount would have been far too much. Definitely making this again, it's delicious!"</blockquote>
    <blockquote>"Add lots of lemon otherwise the flavour won’t be very good"</blockquote>
    <blockquote>"I made this lemon cake and splendid recipe, thanks. I don’t have the cake tin as recommended so I used mine the 20cm loosen tin but deeper as well. It turned out nice. Thanks again"</blockquote>
    <blockquote>"Super easy and delicious cake. However, it is not indicated in the recipe where to put the lemon juice, I poured it into the batter and it was fantastic. Also you do not need more than 200 g of powder sugar for the glazing."</blockquote>
