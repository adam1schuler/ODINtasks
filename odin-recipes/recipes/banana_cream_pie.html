        <h2>You Can Taste the difference of Homemade</h2>
        First thing‚Äôs first! This is a completely from-scratch banana cream pie recipe.
         There will be no boxes, zero mixes, zippity zilch shortcuts. Banana cream 
         pie is such a specialty and while I‚Äôve definitely made this delicacy with 
         pudding mixes in the past, we all deserve to try it the homemade way. 
         Because I assure you: you can taste the difference. And it will graciously 
         satisfy your heart, soul, and stomach.
    </p>
    <p>Let‚Äôs walk through this. Start with a pie crust shell. If you have a favorite 
        pie crust recipe you prefer to use, go ahead! The pie crust must be blind-baked 
        before it‚Äôs filled because the filling itself will not be baked. The pie will 
        set up in the refrigerator, not the oven. The best way to blind-bake your pie 
        crust is to use pie weights. If the pie weights are left out, the pie crust 
        could shrink.

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sugar </strong>The sweet banana cream pie filling starts with white sugar.<li>
        <li><strong>Flour </strong>All-purpose flour helps thicken the creamy filling.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt: </strong>A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make your pie taste salty.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk </strong>Two cups of milk lends moisture and thins the filling.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg yolks </strong>Four egg yolks help create a rich, decadent texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter </strong>Butter adds even more moisture and richness.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla </strong>A dash of vanilla enhances the overall flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Pie shell </strong>Use a store-bought pastry crust or make your own at home. Some reviewers prefer using a graham cracker crust.</li>
        <li><strong>Bananas </strong>Of course, you'll need bananas! About four, to be exact.</li>
