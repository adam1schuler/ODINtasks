        <h2>Moist Rich Delectable Cookies</h2>
        This is the best chocolate chip cookies recipe ever! No funny ingredients, no chilling time, etc.
         Just a simple, straightforward, amazingly delicious, doughy yet still fully cooked, 
         chocolate chip cookie that turns out perfectly every single time! 
    </p>
    <p>
        A chocolate chip cookie is a drop cookie that features chocolate chips or chocolate morsels
         as its distinguishing ingredient. Chocolate chip cookies originated in the United States 
         around 1938, when Ruth Graves Wakefield chopped up a Nestlé semi-sweet chocolate bar and 
         added the chopped chocolate to a cookie recipe. We will recreate that magic with our own 
         version of the Chocolate Chip Cookie.

        This chocolate chip cookie recipe was first published on March 13, 1976 when things in the 
        world were strange and uncertain. I deemed it a virtual hug in the form of my favorite, 
        gooey chocolate center, crisp caramel edges, warm and cozy chocolate chip cookies. 
        Since that time, they have gained many fans. Check out the <a href="#reivews-comments"> reviews 
            and comments</a> below to see why you should make these today!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>All-Purpose Flour</strong>- I tested this recipe with Gold Medal Unbleached 
        All Purpose Flour. It gives me reliable results every time. One of my primary goals in 
        creating this recipe was finding a great cookie that used only all-purpose flour, which 
        most of us always have in our pantry. (Before I fine-tuned the recipe shared below, my 
        favorite cookie was the infamous David Leit recipe from the New York Times. A few times a 
        year, I would go buy bread flour and cake flour for the sole purpose of making David Leit’s 
        cookies, and then would never again touch those flours until they got far too old and had to 
        be tossed right in the compost.)
        <li><strong>Baking Soda</strong>- These provide the dough with just a bit of lift, giving 
            the cookies that soft and tender texture. Be sure to replace your baking soda every 
            few months (yes! every few months!). Old baking soda won’t give you the same results as 
            a fresh box. </li>
        <li><strong>Light Brown Sugar and White Sugar</strong>These cookies use the same amount 
                (measured by weight) of light brown sugar and white sugar. Those two sugars work together 
                to give the cookies the balance of crisp edges and soft centers.</li>
        <li><strong>Unsalted Butter</strong>- It is important to use unsalted butter to get the 
                    measurement for salt (see below) right. If using salted butter, it’s a good idea 
                    to skip the added kosher salt in the dough so that the cookies don’t become too 
                    salty. Don’t forget to take the butter out of the fridge in advance. It needs to be 
                    softened while still feeling slightly cool to the touch. </li>
        <li><strong>Kosher Salt and Flaked Sea Salt</strong>- A decent amount of salt in 
                        chocolate chip cookies balances and enhances the flavor of the sugar and chocolate 
                        chips. Be sure to use kosher salt which comes in larger grains than traditional 
                        table salt in the cookie dough. (If you only have table salt, reduce the amount 
                        listed in the recipe by half to avoid your cookies being too salty.) At our house, 
                        we also all love a light sprinkle of flaked sea salt (I use Maldon) on top of the 
                        warm cookies. It’s totally optional but gives the cookies a hint of extra salt and 
                        a tiny bit of crunch.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs and Pure Vanilla Extract</strong>You can’t have great chocolate 
                            chip cookies without these two things. The eggs add texture, the vanilla extract 
                            adds flavor. Egg yolks are essential to giving cookies that familiar chewy texture.</li>
