        <h1>Extra Page</h1>
        <p>
            <a href="../index.html">homepage</a>this link will take you to our <strong>homepage</strong>.
            this is an example of a <mark>relative link</mark> because
            it is linking to another page within our website.
        </p>
        <p> 
            <a href="./about.html">about page</a>this link will take us to our <strong>about page</strong>. 
            this is another example of a <mark>relative link</mark> because
            it is also linking to another page within our website.
            <!-- relative links can be a bit tricky
            properly linking to the page when 
            using multiple folders can be designated with
             './' to take you to a page in the same folder
            and '../'to take you to the folder above that-->

          this link is a <mark>absolute link</mark> it links us to a page outside 
          the website i am building. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https:www.google.com">GOOGLE</a> This is another <mark>absolute link</mark>
            it is taking us to the google page.
        </p>
        <p>
            on this <mark>EXTRA page</mark> i am going to add some pictures to get some practice.
            i am finding the writing out what i am doing helps me, to both retain and better 
            understand what i am doing. So most of the words i am writing can be completely ignored.
            but i would suggest that when you are doing your own practice with these exercises,
            to do the same.</p>
            <p>
                <!-- made a simpl mistake when trying to do this, typed ;scr' not 'src'. this caused
                a broken image pic, and added my alternate text.-->
                I have learned through my work in the real world, <img src="https://www.ibew100.org/pics/logo_IBEW.png" alt="image of the ibew shield"> as a union electrician, that it often helps 
            with my comprehension of the work to explain it to an apprentice that is working 
            directly under me. so i am treating my experiences with the <mark><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/"> ODIN project</a></mark> 
            in the same manner. This paragraph has a picture from a website outside my own,
            This can be useful to save storage space when uploading your files to a server. 
            but, this means you are relying on an outside source for your web content.
            if they have issues with their server, or they decide to take the images
            you <mark>linked to</mark> down, then you will only be showing the <em>'alt'</em> text.
        </p><!--i noticed when i added the link to the odin project, that i put the </a> closing tag on the wrong side of the </mark> closing tag.
             this seemed to cause the link to not work. be careful where you place you closing tags-->
        <p>
            In this paragraph i will link to some pictures that i will add to the images folder on my website.
            <img src="../images/elephant.jpg"alt="picture of a small elephant figurine">
            <img src="../images/small_penguin.jpg" alt="picture of a puffin">
            You can see from the above pictures that they lay out on the page stacked one on<sup>top</sup> 
            of each other. page layout is something that will be covered in future tasks. 
            when using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">vsCODE</a> as you text editor, as the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">ODIN project</a>
            suggests, you will find it is very easy to navigate through you different folders 
            that you have set up to help keep the back end of you website organized.
            </p>
            <p> through out these tasks that we are doing, we are often referred to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4-IK0AVhVjM0xE0K2uZRvsM7LkIhsPT-">YouTube</a>
                page of a person named <mark>Kevin Powell</mark>. Having gone through many of the <mark>FREE!</mark> 
                online courses from <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog">Code Academy</a> 
                the tutorials <mark>Kevin</mark> has made seem kind of <del>corny</del> to me, but i find using more than 
                one source of information helps to strengthen my understanding of the material.

            <h2>GitHub</h2>
            <p>     As i mentioned in the <a href="https://t.me/New_code_learning">New to code TG</a> i am keeping a running 
                repo of everything that i am doing. i still need more practice with adding to my <a href="https://github.com/adam1schuler?tab=repositories">GitHub</a>
                <mark>REPO</mark> . So even if no one ever uses what i am providing, it is still really good practice for me along my learning process.

            <h2>Coursera</h2>
            <p>
                    Also as i mentioned in our <a href="https://t.me/New_code_learning">New to code TG</a>
                i am taking another <mark>FREE!</mark> online course about learning how to learn.
                <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> is where you can find information about,
                and where you can register for the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn?utm_source=gg&utm_medium=sem&utm_campaign=04-CourseraPlus-US&utm_content=B2C&campaignid=9777751587&adgroupid=100171642259&device=c&keyword=coursera%20%2B&matchtype=b&network=g&devicemodel=&adpostion=&creativeid=442114125114&hide_mobile_promo=&gclid=CjwKCAiA7IGcBhA8EiwAFfUDsUL5u6FRiu6M_Q7o7-x1j_2hY58Yg3U6fNzCf6mJeT5IgkbqEL9aWBoCfqQQAvD_BwE">
                    Learning how to Learn</a> class. I spend one day a week on this, managing to get through one section easily,
                    and spend the rest of the week on the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/"><mark>ODIN project</mark></a>
                    as you can see, i am practicing a lot with links and elements. further strengthening my 
                    abilities. <img src="../images/crown.png" alt="small image of a cartoon crown">
                    <!-- the first image i saved looked way to big on the page, so i downloaded another pic and replaced 
                    the image file link in the <img src> -->
                    This is another example of an image that is  a <mark>relative link</mark> as i downloaded the image
                    to my <em>images folder</em>
