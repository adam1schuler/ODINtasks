    <!-- when making this page, i forgot to add '.html' to 'img_formats'
     when trying to link from index page it didn't work.
     after resaving img_formats to img_formats.html i had to go back 
     and recreat the link to thew updated name.-->

        <h1>Image formats used in HTML pages</h1>
        <p>
            I found this exercise in the assingments through the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/"><mark>ODIN<sub>project</sub></mark></a>
            so i will be exploring this here. 
            Personally i do not know much about what the different file formats 
            and extensions. so this will be interesting.
            going throught the site, i found it wasn't much of an exersize,
            but more of an explainer, so used it to work more with lists and nested lists.

        <p> Attrabute deffinition: 
        <OL>
            <li>a quality or feature regarded as a characteristic or inherent part of someone or something.</li>
            <li>a piece of information which determines the properties of a field or tag in a database or a string of characters in a display.</li>
        </OL> 
        Attrabutes are what go inside the 'a' & 'img' elements, such as but not limited to:
         <ul>
            <li>href</li>
            <li>src</li>
            <li>alt</li>
        </ul>
        <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/html-cheat-sheet/">Here</a> is a good reference for information
         about attrabutes as they pertain to HTML documents.

                there was much more than i intended. i moved </strong> to where it curently is-->
            <strong>The formats we will be exploring are:</strong>

                    <li>.jpg</li>
                    <li>.gif</li>

            An exapmle of the 4 file types, can be downloaded from here: <a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/links-and-images/images-4149f7.zip">mochi images</a>
            <p>The four images are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><img src="../images/images/mochi.jpg" alt="cute pic of smiling face">JPG images are good for photos.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>designed for handling large color palettes without exorbitantly increasing file size.</li>
                    <li>great for photos and images with lots of gradients in them</li>
                    <li>don’t allow for transparent pixels,</li>
                </ul>
                <li><img src="../images/images/mochi.gif" alt="cute pic of smiling face">GIFs are good for animations.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>the go-to option for simple animations,</li>
                    <li>never use them for photos</li>
                    <li>better to use PNG images if you don’t need animation.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><img src="../images/images/mochi.png"alt="cute pic of smiling face">PNGs are good for diagrams and icons.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>great for anything that’s not a photo or animated.</li>
                    <li>would generally be bigger than an equivalent JPG file.</li>
                    <li>don’t have color palette limitations.</li>
                    <li>they do deal with opacity just fine</li>
                    <li>excellent fit for icons, technical diagrams, logos</li>
                </ul>
                <li><img src="../images/images/mochi.svg" alt="cute pic of smiling face">SVGs are <em>amazing</em>. Use them wherever you can.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>SVG is a vector-based graphics format</li>
                    <li>can scale up or down to any dimension without loss of quality</li>
                    <li>all the same use cases as PNGs</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
