      <a href="https://t.me/New_code_learning">NEW to Code TG</a>
      Just wanted to add another <em>link</em> here as an example of an absolute link 
      </p>
      <p>
      <a href="../index.html">home page</a> and here is a realative link , 
      back to the <del>home page</del> of this website<sub>(the more you use different aspect, the better you retain them)</sub> i am building here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="./extra.html">EXTRA page</a> one of the reasons why you have a 
      navigation pag for your website<sup>(just praticing here)</sup>, 
      is so you don't have to create all of these <mark>
        realative links</mark> on each page you create.
        a navagation bar would follow you through each Pageyou navigate to.
        allowing you to concentrate more on the design of
        the indavidual pages, rather than navagation.

    <!-- it is good practice to always read through your pages
    through the web browser, often you can find typos and mistakes
    better to find them yourself rather than someone else point
    them out to you-->

  <!-- important to remember to save a page after each time making
changes to it, in VScode you can easily do this with 
ctrl+s-->
