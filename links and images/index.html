        <H2>More work with links</H2>
        I am going to add some links here as an 
        example of 'absolute links' as they are called.
        It is explained in the reading that an absolute link 
        is one that takes you to an outside website,
        seperate from the one i am creating here.
        <a href="http://www.google.com" >GOOGLE</a>
        <!-- above link opens the google webpage-->
        </p>
        <p>
        <a href="./pages/about.html">About</a> This link takes 
        me to the about page of this website, this is an example of a realative link.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="./pages/extra.html">EXTRA page</a> It is good to create
        a few different pages, with in this website, i am finding it to
        be good practice, both with getting comfortable with creating <em>links</em>, 
        and also with learning how to use the <mark>hirerarchy</mark> of
        folders with in a website.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Image File Extensions</h2>
        This will be a new Page about the differences in file extansions for images.
        the 4 types will be:
        <ul>
            <li>.jpg</li>
            <li>.gif</li>
            <li>.png</li>
            <li>.svg</li>
        </ul>
        i am not familure at all with the last .svg, 
        and am not familure with when to use each type at all.

    <!-- becareful of typos, just a simple swap of the 'r' and the 'e'
      in href and it definately won't work, best for me to know,
    what the different abreviations mean href=hyperlink reference-->
