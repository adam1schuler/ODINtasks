        <h1><mark></mark>this is what</mark><sub>the page is about</sub> </h1>
        <h2>this is a paragraph about what i am doing on this page</h2>
        <!--i need to start using this, 
            so when i look back at my html i 
            can see what i was thinking-->
        <p><strong>It seems really silly to be doing this
            over and over</strong>, but at the same time,
            this is how it becomes second nature.
            so in the futre, i will hopefully <em>not</em>
            have to come back and look this stuff 
            covered in this topic again. so i will 
            be doing this a few times so i can get it
            right. all these extra lines are just 
            so i have something to use the <b>bold</b> 
            tag and the <i>italic</i> tag. <small>but i wanted to 
            have a lot of text down before i went back 
            and added the tags</small>. i was thinking about 
            just coping something off the web to 
            accomplish this, but i neeed the practice 
            typing things out. so i decided to write it 
            all out myself. now i feel like i have 
            <sup>enough text.</sup>
        </p>
            <!--is better to add the bold and italic tags
            while you are typing out the paragraph 
            if you go back and do it later in VScode 
            then you need cut the close tag and paste it
             where you need it. by default VSC adds the close 
              tag right way-->
        </p>
        <h2><em>this</em> is to see if <strong>works</strong> in the headings</h2>
        <p>
            <strong><mark>Here</mark> is where</strong> i am writing a paragraph 
            after my first. <em>this</em> is the paraghraph where 
            i am adding the tags as i am writing. i feel like today i am making 
            progress with <sub>increasing</sub> the size of my <strong>HTML</strong> <em>chunk</em>
            soon i will be able to start adding to the size of 
            this chunk, and <del>it will get stored</del> in my long term memory.
        </p>
        <!--looks like <em> works in the headings, but <strong> does not.
            i suppose because it is already bold.
            also, it does look like <b> and <i> work as discribed-->
                <h3><del>after</del> using Forrmatting Elements</h3>
                <p>if you don't look at all the suplumental material 
                    in the <mark>ODIN project</mark> you won't see the 
                    extra features that are availiable to use. So it is important,
                    to go <sub>and click through all the material</sub><sup>
                        so you can see all the cool things
                    </sup>that you can do with <bold>HTML</bold>
                    <i>elements</i>
                    <!--need to be careful with your spacing around
                    the element tags, it is easy to forget that you need 
                    to add spaces after the tags, not in the tags,
                    or not at all-->
